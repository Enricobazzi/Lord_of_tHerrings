## Herring project

First step into the project is going to be to familiarize myself with the [GenErode pipeline](https://github.com/NBISweden/GenErode/wiki): check the [GenErode](./GenErode.md) markdown.

In the [Samples_tracking](./Samples_Tracking.md) markdown I keep notes on samples and storage.

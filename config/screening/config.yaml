# Parameters:
# Set a fixed combination of the following parameters for a given run.

# Minimum SNP count. For example, 10, 25. Abbreviation in file name: homsnp.

# Maximum number of heterozygote sites per window. 
# For example, 1 for a stringent analysis, 3 for a relaxed setting. 
# Abbreviation in file name: homwinhet.

# Maximum number of missing sites per window. 
# For example, 1 or 5 for a stringent analysis,

# Abbreviation in file name: homwinmis.
homozyg-window-missing: 5 
# Maximum number of heterozygote sites per ROH.

# Rules for GERP score and relative mutational load calculations#
#################################################################

#####
# Estimate GERP scores for the reference genome of the target species,
# based on at least 30 outgroup genomes and a dated phylogenetic tree,
# and (optionally) calculate relative mutational load per sample from 
# GERP scores and counts of derived alleles per site and sample from 
# filtered per-sample BCF files (homozygous sites counted as 2 derived alleles 
# and heterozygous sites as 1 derived allele). Sites from the BED file not 
# passing the missingness and biallelic sites filter across all samples 
# are removed per default from the per-sample BCF files. 
# Relative mutational load is calculated per sample for all sites with 
# GERP scores within "min_gerp" and "max_gerp" (specified below) based on 
# the counts of derived alleles for these sites.
# Automatically generates a PDF file with a histogram of GERP scores
# that can be used to choose minimum and maximum GERP score thresholds, and
# a PDF file with a plot of relative mutational load estimates per sample 
# that can be retrieved from the GenErode pipeline report.
# Requires path to reference genome as provided at the top of this 
# config file. If relative mutational load should be calculated per sample, 
# metadata files with historical and/or modern samples are required.
# If metadata files are provided, sample lists and parameters for any 
# desired optional data filtering step (as described above) are required. 
gerp: False

# Full path to directory containing reference genomes of outgroup species in 
# FASTA format for GERP++ score estimation.
# Files must be gzipped and FASTA file name extensions can be 
# "*.fa.gz", "*.fasta.gz" or "*.fna.gz".
gerp_ref_path: ""

# Full path to phylogenetic tree of all species included in the analysis 
# (including the target species) in NEWICK format and including divergence 
# time estimates.
# Divergence time estimates must be in millions of years for consistent scaling 
# of GERP scores across GenErode runs. Dated phylogenetic trees in millions of years 
# are e.g. available from www.timetree.org.
# Species names in the tree must be identical to the FASTA file names 
# without ".fa.gz", ".fasta.gz" or ".fna.gz".
tree: ""

# Minimum and maximum GERP score for a site to be included into calculations 
# of relative mutational load.
# Positive values indicate purifying selection.
min_gerp: 0
max_gerp: 1000

#####
# NOTE:
# The GERP step produces a large number of large intermediate files,
# so several TB of storage space may required during a pipeline run.
# The required storage space for intermediate files scales with the 
# numbers of outgroup genomes and samples.
# The number of intermediate files scales additionally with the level of
# fragmentation of the reference genome (i.e. with the number of contigs/
# scaffolds).
